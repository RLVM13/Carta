        <h2>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h2>
        Dear Eileen,<br><br>
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science faculty to study as part<br>of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.<br>
        <h2>Starting dates</h2>
        We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br>could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
            <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
            <li>Third semester 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>
        Please let me know if this is ok. and if so which start date you would prefer. <br><br>
        You can find more information about <a href="#">important university dates</a> on our website. <br>
        <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
        At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall <br> somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br>the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br>by are as follows, in order of priority:<br>
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Rcsveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaycrs at tcmpraturcs exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the <br>audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 > 3 x 104.)</li>
            <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
        So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br> research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks. <br>
        <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
        Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, <br> my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions: <br><br>
        Polynesian chicken dance
        <blockquote>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC. a whole village would dance around <br>in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful*.</blockquote>
        Icelandic brownian shuffle<blockquote>
        Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br>involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in impcrccptably <br>tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br> modem styles such as Twerking.</blockquote>
        Arctic robot dance <blockquote>An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br> discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic*, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br>of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>because they were really cold.</blockquote>
        For more of my research, see my <a href="#">exotic dance research page.</a><br><br>
        Yours sincerely. <br><br><br><br><br>
        Dr Eleanor Gaye <br><br>
